			<h1>Aaron Kaswen-Wilk</h1>
			<h2>Web Developer</h1>
			<p>I’ve always considered myself a problem solver.  Whether it was a straightforward math problem from school, or a life problem to do with visas (funny story with some misunderstandings, I can explain later), I’ve usually found myself as someone who likes to figure out solutions to things.  When I discovered programming, it really managed to scratch an itch that I hadn’t been able to get for a while in my past career.  With performance, the work tended to fall on memorizing words, music, and staging to the point where you could perform without thinking.  Even when I was a private teacher, the best parts for me (other than seeing my students succeed of course!) was figuring out the best way to communicate what my student needed to do in a way that they would best understand it.  But with web development, I really feel a connection.  I was surprised when I first began learning that I could sit in front of a computer for hours at a time writing code.  The complex problems and learning all were very fun and therefore, the time just flew by.  I still enjoy music of course, and I don’t regret all the time I spent dedicating myself to learning piano and voice.  I’m especially excited now to bring all those skills I learned to something new.  Namely, the ability to sit down and focus for hours at a time.  Therefore it is with pride and excitement that I refer to myself as a Ruby on Rails developer!</p>
