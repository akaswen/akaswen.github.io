					<p class="text-justify">I’ve always considered myself a problem solver.  Whether it was a straightforward math problem from school, or a life problem to do with visas (funny story with some misunderstandings, I can explain later), I’ve usually found myself as someone who likes to figure out solutions to things.  When I discovered programming, it really managed to scratch an itch that I hadn’t been able to get for a while in my past career as an opera singer.  With performance, the work tended to fall on memorizing words, music, and staging to the point where you could perform without much thinking.  Even when I was a private teacher, the best parts for me (other than seeing my students succeed of course!) were figuring out the best way to communicate what my student needed to do in a way that they would best understand it.  But with web development, I really feel a connection.  I was surprised when I first began learning that I could sit in front of a computer for many hours at a time writing code.  The complex problems and learning  were very fun and therefore, the time would fly by.  I still enjoy music of course, and I don’t regret any of the time I spent dedicating myself to learning piano and voice.  I’m especially excited now to bring all those skills I learned to something new.  Namely, the ability to sit down and focus for hours at a time.  Thus it is with pride and excitement that I refer to myself as a Ruby on Rails developer!</p>

								<p class="d-none d-sm-inline">I made this project based on my interest in stock market investing.  This app allows you to generate various portfolios with custom allocations of various stocks.  It then uses an api provided by iex to pull up to 5 years' worth of history for each stock and calculates the average returns for different periods.  You can register an account and give it a try, and also see all of the other portfolios other users have made (and how successful they may or may not have been).  I also used this project as an opportunity to teach myself rspec (as opposed to minitest which I had been using in the past).</p>
