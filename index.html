					<p class="text-justify">I’ve always considered myself a problem solver, whether it was a straightforward math problem from school, or a life problem to do with visas (funny story).  When I discovered programming, it satisfied a need in me I hadn’t been able to fulfill in my career as an opera singer for some time. Opera had become memorizing words, music, and staging to the point where I could perform without a lot of thinking, no real new problems to solve.  As a private music teacher, the best part of the job was figuring out the best way to communicate what my student needed to do in a way that they would understand and be able to execute it.  With web development, I really felt a connection. I was surprised when I first began that I could sit in front of a computer for many hours at a time writing code. Solving complex problems and learning was very fun and therefore, the time would fly by.  I still enjoy music of course, and I don’t regret any of the time I spent dedicating myself to learning piano and voice.  Now, I’m especially excited to bring the skills dedication I once brought to music to a new career path.Thus it is with pride and excitement that I refer to myself as a Ruby on Rails developer!</p>

								<p class="d-none d-sm-inline">I made this project based on my interest in stock market investing.  This app allows you to generate various portfolios with custom allocations of various stocks.  It then uses an api provided by iex to pull up to 5 years' worth of history for each stock and calculates the average returns for different periods.  You can register an account and give it a try, and also see all of the other portfolios other users have made (and how successful they may or may not have been).  I also used this project as an opportunity to teach myself rspec (as opposed to minitest which I had been using in the past).</p>

							<p class="d-none d-sm-inline">This is a very simple app I built to teach myself Sinatra.  I didn’t want to get pigeonholed into Ruby On Rails, and felt it would be important to also have experience in different web-building frameworks. Simply input any word or phrase, select the offset number, and an encoded message will be generated.</p>
